# Dysarthric-Automatic-Speech-Recognition-System-
We propose a novel approach for dysarthric speech recognition using Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) to extract vision-based Mel scale spectrogram features. These features are classified using a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) model, addressing variability and non-linear distortions in dysarthric speech for accurate recognition.

Dysarthria, a speech sound disorder, arises from neurological damage to the motor component of the motor-speech system. This condition is marked by inadequate articulation of phonemes, stemming from difficulties in the muscles responsible for speech production. Pronouncing words becomes notably challenging due to these issues and individuals with dysarthria face challenges, both with other people and computer-based systems. This project revolves around the automatic speech recognition of individuals with dysarthria, utilizing The Dysarthric Speech Database. The primary methodology employed in this study is the Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR). This ASR technology has emerged as a potential interaction medium; however, its performance is suboptimal in severe dysarthric cases. To address this limitation, we propose Speech Vision (SV), a dysarthria-specific ASR system. SV operates by extracting speech features visually, enabling it to learn the visual shape of pronounced words. The findings may have significant implications for improving therapeutic interventions and communication support in this population.
