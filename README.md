# Dysarthric-Automatic-Speech-Recognition-System-
We propose a novel approach for dysarthric speech recognition using Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) to extract vision-based Mel scale spectrogram features. These features are classified using a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) model, addressing variability and non-linear distortions in dysarthric speech for accurate recognition.
